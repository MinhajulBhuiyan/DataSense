Common Business Scenarios
=========================

1. Calculate net revenue for a distributor.
2. Track stock movements and current levels.
3. Identify partially delivered invoices.
4. Monitor pending returns and refunds.
5. Analyze payment status (paid/unpaid/partial).
6. Vehicle utilization and load planning.
7. Return rate analysis by product/distributor.
8. Inventory turnover and stock alerts.

These scenarios can be used as example prompts or few-shot pairs when
training or fine‑tuning to make the model follow expected patterns.
